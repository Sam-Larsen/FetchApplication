1. I chose to use java as it is my most comfortable language.
In the project I used a PriorityQueue and a HashMap. I used a PriorityQueue because it
allows for a list to be sorted based on a specified condition, in this case the date. This 
was useful because it allowed the use of a list without having to run a sort. I also used a HashMap
for total points per payer because it associates a single key the payer, with a value, the total points, and
allows for easy addition to the values associated with each key, which is useful for summing the points.
Other than that, I used a scanner to read the file and the Date class to read the date format as it was easily adaptable.

2. My solutions advantages are that it does not require a sorting method, because the PriorityQueue polls
in the desired order. The disadvantage is that it is more difficult to store the data once you've accessed it,
since you need another data structure to hold that information.

3. My favorite project so far was a project that required us to create a simulation of a vending machine.
The project was enjoyable because it required us to create a working simulation of all parts including the
accepting of money, inventory of the machine an the change return. Not only did it require us to return these values,
but we had to keep an active inventory of the items in the machine and the money of each type in the money box. This
was fun because you could really see the real world application of the program. Overall it was not the most difficult
project, however some aspects did present challenges like the display class and the implementation of the change return
since it had to return accurate change which had a few odd corner cases.
